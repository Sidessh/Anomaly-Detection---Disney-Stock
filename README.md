# Anomaly-Detection---Disney-Stock
Anomaly detection is a critical task for financial market, investors, and regulatory authorities.
In recent years, machine learning and deep learning techniques have become increasingly promising for detecting anomalous trading behaviors. 
Here I present a deep learning model LSTM Autoencoder to detect anomalous behaviors in Disney Stock Price.
LSTM Autoencoders are based on an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture to encode and decode sequence data.
